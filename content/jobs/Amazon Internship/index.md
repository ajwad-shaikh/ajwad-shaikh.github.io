- Worked with a Tier-1 service supporting checkout and fullfillment operations at Amazon under the [Last Mile Org](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/last-mile-org).

- Redesigned client request workflows to reduce SDE-dependency by separating business configurations from code-base through a low-latency local-cache enabled remote config provider service.

- Improved turn-around time for business requests by over 80%, also saving at least 20 SDE days annually within team.
