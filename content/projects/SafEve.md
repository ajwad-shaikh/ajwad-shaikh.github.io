The device aims to enhance safety of users with limited access or knowledge of technology viz. rural population, children. The device features a trigger button that sends a geo-tagged distress signal wirelessly over 2G band to nearby help viz. a police station. It works as an independent device and NOT as a peripheral to a Smartphone or Computer.
